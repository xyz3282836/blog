This was <code>despite</code> the <code>turmoil</code> in energy the markets caused by Russia’s <code>invasion</code> of Ukraine. The rise is smaller than the 6% increase in emissions from energy recorded by the IEA in 2021, a <code>leap</code> that came on the back of the <code>rebound</code> from the Covid-19 pandemic. However, a 7% reduction is needed every year to meet the goal of <code>halving</code> emissions this decade.</p><div class="hint-container info"><p class="hint-container-title">tips</p><p>carbon：碳</p><p>dioxide：二氧化碳</p><p>emission：排放，发射</p><p>plateau：高地，上升后的稳定水平（plat- 平）</p><p>despite：虽然，尽管；轻视，憎恨；（despise：轻视）</p><p>trumoil：混乱，骚动</p><p>invasion：侵犯，侵入（invade：侵略）</p><p>leap：跳跃，飞跃</p><p>rebound：返回，弹回，产生事与愿违的结果（bound：回跳）</p><p>halve：vt. 减半（half）</p></div>',2),n=[r];function s(c,l){return t(),a("div",null,n)}const m=e(i,[["render",s],["__file","2303061929.html.vue"]]),h=JSON.parse('{"path":"/english/everyday/2023/2303061929.html","title":"CO2 emissions may be starting to plateau, says global energy watchdog","lang":"zh-CN","frontmatter":{"title":"CO2 emissions may be starting to plateau, says global energy watchdog","date":"2023-03-06T11:29:00.000Z","category":"英文","tag":["everyday"],"description":"Global carbon dioxide emissions are still rising but may at least be reaching a plateau, research from the International Energy Agency has shown.
