Gert-Jan Oskam, 40, was told he would never walk again after breaking his neck in a traffic accident, but has climbed <code>stairs</code> and walked for more than 100 metres at a time since having the operation. “A few months ago, I was able, for the first time after 10 years, to stand up and have a <code>beer</code> with my friends,” said Oskam. “That was pretty cool. I want to use it in my daily life.”</p><div class="hint-container tip"><p class="hint-container-title">tips</p><p>paralyse：使瘫痪；比喻动弹不得</p><p>paralysed：瘫痪的</p><p>implant：移植；嵌入</p><p>spine：脊柱（spine- 脊柱，原意为刺）</p><p>stair：阶梯；楼梯</p><p>beer：啤酒 🍺</p></div>',2),s=[r];function o(c,d){return t(),a("div",null,s)}const h=e(n,[["render",o],["__file","2305280601.html.vue"]]),m=JSON.parse('{"path":"/english/everyday/2023/2305280601.html","title":"Paralysed man walks using device that reconnects brain with muscles","lang":"zh-CN","frontmatter":{"title":"Paralysed man walks using device that reconnects brain with muscles","date":"2023-05-27T22:01:00.000Z","category":"英文","tag":["everyday"],"description":"A man who was paralysed in a cycling accident in 2011 has been able to stand and walk with an aid after doctors implanted a device that reads his brain waves and sends instructi...","head":[["meta",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://blog.ruizhou.cf/english/everyday/2023/2305280601.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"rz blog"}],["meta",{"property":"og:title","content":"Paralysed man walks using device that reconnects brain with muscles"}],["meta",{"property":"og:description","content":"A man who was paralysed in a cycling accident in 2011 has been able to stand and walk with an aid after doctors implanted a device that reads his brain waves and sends instructi..."}],["meta",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["meta",{"property":"og:locale","content":"zh-CN"}],["meta",{"property":"og:updated_time","content":"2024-01-23T11:30:36.000Z"}],["meta",{"property":"article:author","content":"ruizhou"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"everyday"}],["meta",{"property":"article:published_time","content":"2023-05-27T22:01:00.000Z"}],["meta",{"property":"article:modified_time","content":"2024-01-23T11:30:36.000Z"}],["script",{"type":"application/ld+json"},"{\\"@context\\":\\"https://schema.org\\",\\"@type\\":\\"Article\\",\\"headline\\":\\"Paralysed man walks using device that reconnects brain with muscles\\",\\"image\\":[\\"\\"],\\"datePublished\\":\\"2023-05-27T22:01:00.000Z\\",\\"dateModified\\":\\"2024-01-23T11:30:36.000Z\\",\\"author\\":[{\\"@type\\":\\"Person\\",\\"name\\":\\"ruizhou\\",\\"url\\":\\"https://blog.ruizhou.cf\\"}]}"]]},"headers":[],"git":{"createdTime":1685265959000,"updatedTime":1706009436000,"contributors":[{"name":"liuruizhou","email":"liuruizhou@bilibili.com","commits":1}]},"readingTime":{"minutes":0.6,"words":181},"filePathRelative":"english/everyday/2023/2305280601.md","localizedDate":"2023年5月28日","excerpt":"","autoDesc":true}');export{h as comp,m as data};
