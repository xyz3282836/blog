The rare copy of Bilbo Baggins’ <code>tale</code> was <code>stumbled</code> upon by a manager of the Cancer Research UK superstore in Dundee. As the store only sells items for £5 or less, the book was put up for sale on eBay, where it made £10,099.50 for the charity. The book is one of the first 1,500 copies of the children’s literature classic, which sold out soon after publication in 1937 due to <code>rave</code> reviews. These editions include black and white <code>illustrations</code> by Tolkien himself.</p><div class="hint-container tip"><p class="hint-container-title">tips</p><p>charity：慈善</p><p>tale：故事</p><p>stumble：偶然发现；遇见；绊倒</p><p>rave：咆哮；狂暴</p><p>illustration：插图</p></div>',2),n=[a];function s(c,l){return t(),o("div",null,n)}const h=e(r,[["render",s],["__file","2307161901.html.vue"]]),u=JSON.parse('{"path":"/english/everyday/2023/2307161901.html","title":"First edition of The Hobbit found in Dundee charity shop sells for £10,000","lang":"zh-CN","frontmatter":{"title":"First edition of The Hobbit found in Dundee charity shop sells for £10,000","date":"2023-07-16T11:01:00.000Z","category":"英文","tag":["everyday"],"description":"A first edition copy of JRR Tolkien’s The Hobbit has sold for more than £10,000 after being discovered in a charity shop.
