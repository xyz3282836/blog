Since 2003, regulations in China <code>dictate</code> that citizens must provide both a government-issued photo ID and a household register, also known as the hukou, when registering a marriage. However, in the comment on the website on June 27, the netizen argued that this requirement is unreasonable, <code>asserting</code> that the photo ID carries the same legal weight as the household register. The Ministry of Civil Affairs has acknowledged the suggestion and expressed their intention to examine it further.</p><div class="hint-container tip"><p class="hint-container-title">tips</p><p>consent：同意；许可（sent- 感觉；共同感觉，同意）</p><p>spark：除了火花；闪光的意思，还有<strong>发动</strong>的意思</p><p>civil：公民的</p><p>Ministry of <code>Civil</code> Affairs：民政部</p><p>debate：讨论（de- 加强，bat- 打，加强打击，反驳，辨论）</p><p>mandatory：命令的</p><p>dictate：听写；命令；指挥</p><p>government-issued：政府发布的</p><p>household：家庭的</p><p>assert：主张；断言（sert- 插入）</p></div>',2),n=[r];function s(p,d){return t(),i("div",null,n)}const h=e(a,[["render",s],["__file","2307191901.html.vue"]]),m=JSON.parse('{"path":"/english/everyday/2023/2307191901.html","title":"Plea for Marriage Rules Reform Sparks Debate on Parental Consent","lang":"zh-CN","frontmatter":{"title":"Plea for Marriage Rules Reform Sparks Debate on Parental Consent","date":"2023-07-19T11:01:00.000Z","category":"英文","tag":["everyday"],"description":"A suggestion put forward by a netizen on the official website of China’s Ministry of Civil Affairs advocating for simplified marriage registration documents has ignited widespre...","head":[["meta",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://blog.ruizhou.cf/english/everyday/2023/2307191901.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"rz blog"}],["meta",{"property":"og:title","content":"Plea for Marriage Rules Reform Sparks Debate on Parental Consent"}],["meta",{"property":"og:description","content":"A suggestion put forward by a netizen on the official website of China’s Ministry of Civil Affairs advocating for simplified marriage registration documents has ignited widespre..."}],["meta",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["meta",{"property":"og:locale","content":"zh-CN"}],["meta",{"property":"og:updated_time","content":"2024-01-23T11:30:36.000Z"}],["meta",{"property":"article:author","content":"ruizhou"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"everyday"}],["meta",{"property":"article:published_time","content":"2023-07-19T11:01:00.000Z"}],["meta",{"property":"article:modified_time","content":"2024-01-23T11:30:36.000Z"}],["script",{"type":"application/ld+json"},"{\\"@context\\":\\"https://schema.org\\",\\"@type\\":\\"Article\\",\\"headline\\":\\"Plea for Marriage Rules Reform Sparks Debate on Parental Consent\\",\\"image\\":[\\"\\"],\\"datePublished\\":\\"2023-07-19T11:01:00.000Z\\",\\"dateModified\\":\\"2024-01-23T11:30:36.000Z\\",\\"author\\":[{\\"@type\\":\\"Person\\",\\"name\\":\\"ruizhou\\",\\"url\\":\\"https://blog.ruizhou.cf\\"}]}"]]},"headers":[],"git":{"createdTime":1689873478000,"updatedTime":1706009436000,"contributors":[{"name":"liuruizhou","email":"liuruizhou@bilibili.com","commits":1}]},"readingTime":{"minutes":0.77,"words":230},"filePathRelative":"english/everyday/2023/2307191901.md","localizedDate":"2023年7月19日","excerpt":"","autoDesc":true}');export{h as comp,m as data};
