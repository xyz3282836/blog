The results from a major study on “weekend warriors” against more regular exercisers suggest that even when people are too busy to exercise in the working week, making up for the inactivity at the weekend can still improve <code>cardiovascular</code> health. “Our findings suggest that efforts to improve physical activity, even if concentrated within one to two days of the week, should be beneficial for cardiovascular risk,” said Dr Patrick Ellinor, a <code>cardiologist</code> at Massachusetts general hospital in Boston. “It appears that it is the total volume of activity, rather than the pattern, that matters most.”</p><div class="hint-container tip"><p class="hint-container-title">tips</p><p>cram：塞进；临时死记硬背</p><p>stroke：笔画；打击；<strong>中风</strong>；划尾桨</p><p>making up for：弥补</p><p>cardiovascular：心血管的</p></div>',2),s=[i];function n(c,l){return t(),o("div",null,s)}const h=e(r,[["render",n],["__file","2307220601.html.vue"]]),m=JSON.parse('{"path":"/english/everyday/2023/2307220601.html","title":"People who cram week’s exercise into two days still reap heart benefits– study","lang":"zh-CN","frontmatter":{"title":"People who cram week’s exercise into two days still reap heart benefits– study","date":"2023-07-21T22:01:00.000Z","category":"英文","tag":["everyday"],"description":"People who fit an entire week’s recommended exercise into a couple of days have a similarly low risk of heart disease and stroke as those who spread out their physical activity,...","head":[["meta",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://blog.ruizhou.cf/english/everyday/2023/2307220601.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"rz blog"}],["meta",{"property":"og:title","content":"People who cram week’s exercise into two days still reap heart benefits– study"}],["meta",{"property":"og:description","content":"People who fit an entire week’s recommended exercise into a couple of days have a similarly low risk of heart disease and stroke as those who spread out their physical activity,..."}],["meta",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["meta",{"property":"og:locale","content":"zh-CN"}],["meta",{"property":"og:updated_time","content":"2024-01-23T11:30:36.000Z"}],["meta",{"property":"article:author","content":"ruizhou"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"everyday"}],["meta",{"property":"article:published_time","content":"2023-07-21T22:01:00.000Z"}],["meta",{"property":"article:modified_time","content":"2024-01-23T11:30:36.000Z"}],["script",{"type":"application/ld+json"},"{\\"@context\\":\\"https://schema.org\\",\\"@type\\":\\"Article\\",\\"headline\\":\\"People who cram week’s exercise into two days still reap heart benefits– study\\",\\"image\\":[\\"\\"],\\"datePublished\\":\\"2023-07-21T22:01:00.000Z\\",\\"dateModified\\":\\"2024-01-23T11:30:36.000Z\\",\\"author\\":[{\\"@type\\":\\"Person\\",\\"name\\":\\"ruizhou\\",\\"url\\":\\"https://blog.ruizhou.cf\\"}]}"]]},"headers":[],"git":{"createdTime":1690035881000,"updatedTime":1706009436000,"contributors":[{"name":"liuruizhou","email":"liuruizhou@bilibili.com","commits":1}]},"readingTime":{"minutes":0.63,"words":188},"filePathRelative":"english/everyday/2023/2307220601.md","localizedDate":"2023年7月22日","excerpt":"","autoDesc":true}');export{h as comp,m as data};
