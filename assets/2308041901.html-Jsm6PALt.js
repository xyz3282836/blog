Each <code>vertebra</code> weighs over 220 pounds (100 kilograms) and its <code>ribs</code> measure nearly 5 feet (1.4 meters) long. “It’s just exciting to see such a giant animal that’s so different from anything we know,” said Hans Thewissen, a <code>paleontologist</code> at Northeast Ohio Medical University.</p><div class="hint-container tip"><p class="hint-container-title">tips</p><p>contender 竞争者</p><p>blue whale 蓝鲸</p><p>dug dig的过去式，挖</p><p>vertebra 脊椎；椎骨</p><p>tip 提示，建议；给小费；轻碰；倾倒</p><p>scale 范围；程度；等级；规模；<strong>天平</strong></p><p>tip the scales 改变形式</p><p>colossus 巨人；巨像</p><p>colossal 巨大的</p><p>rib 肋骨</p><p>paleontology 古生物学（pale- = old，古；onto- 存在）</p></div>',2),r=[n];function s(l,c){return t(),a("div",null,r)}const p=e(i,[["render",s],["__file","2308041901.html.vue"]]),u=JSON.parse('{"path":"/english/everyday/2023/2308041901.html","title":"The heaviest animal ever may be this ancient whale found in the Peruvian desert","lang":"zh-CN","frontmatter":{"title":"The heaviest animal ever may be this ancient whale found in the Peruvian desert","date":"2023-08-04T11:01:00.000Z","category":"英文","tag":["everyday"],"description":"There could be a new contender for heaviest animal to ever live.
