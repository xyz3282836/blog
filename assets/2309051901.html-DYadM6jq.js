Around 20 royal fans and their pet corgis gathered to walk their dogs outside the palace in central London to remember Queen Elizabeth II a year since her death. Corgis were the late queen’s constant companions since she was a child, and Elizabeth owned around 30 throughout her life. Generations of the dogs <code>descended</code> from Susan, a corgi that was given to the queen on her 18th birthday.</p><div class="hint-container tip"><p class="hint-container-title">tips</p><p>landmark 地标建筑</p><p>spectacle 引人羡慕的东西，景象，场面</p><p>parade 游行</p><p>crown 王冠👑</p><p>tiara 头饰品</p><p>descend 下降；世代相传；后裔</p></div>',2),n=[i];function c(d,s){return t(),a("div",null,n)}const l=e(o,[["render",c],["__file","2309051901.html.vue"]]),m=JSON.parse('{"path":"/english/everyday/2023/2309051901.html","title":"Corgis parade outside Buckingham Palace to remember Queen Elizabeth II a year since her death","lang":"zh-CN","frontmatter":{"title":"Corgis parade outside Buckingham Palace to remember Queen Elizabeth II a year since her death","date":"2023-09-05T11:01:00.000Z","category":"英文","tag":["everyday"],"description":"The changing of the guard at Buckingham Palace may draw tourists from far and wide, but on Sunday visitors to the landmark were treated to a different sort of spectacle: a parad...","head":[["meta",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://blog.ruizhou.cf/english/everyday/2023/2309051901.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"rz blog"}],["meta",{"property":"og:title","content":"Corgis parade outside Buckingham Palace to remember Queen Elizabeth II a year since her death"}],["meta",{"property":"og:description","content":"The changing of the guard at Buckingham Palace may draw tourists from far and wide, but on Sunday visitors to the landmark were treated to a different sort of spectacle: a parad..."}],["meta",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["meta",{"property":"og:locale","content":"zh-CN"}],["meta",{"property":"og:updated_time","content":"2024-01-23T11:30:36.000Z"}],["meta",{"property":"article:author","content":"ruizhou"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"everyday"}],["meta",{"property":"article:published_time","content":"2023-09-05T11:01:00.000Z"}],["meta",{"property":"article:modified_time","content":"2024-01-23T11:30:36.000Z"}],["script",{"type":"application/ld+json"},"{\\"@context\\":\\"https://schema.org\\",\\"@type\\":\\"Article\\",\\"headline\\":\\"Corgis parade outside Buckingham Palace to remember Queen Elizabeth II a year since her death\\",\\"image\\":[\\"\\"],\\"datePublished\\":\\"2023-09-05T11:01:00.000Z\\",\\"dateModified\\":\\"2024-01-23T11:30:36.000Z\\",\\"author\\":[{\\"@type\\":\\"Person\\",\\"name\\":\\"ruizhou\\",\\"url\\":\\"https://blog.ruizhou.cf\\"}]}"]]},"headers":[],"git":{"createdTime":1694097886000,"updatedTime":1706009436000,"contributors":[{"name":"liuruizhou","email":"liuruizhou@bilibili.com","commits":1}]},"readingTime":{"minutes":0.59,"words":178},"filePathRelative":"english/everyday/2023/2309051901.md","localizedDate":"2023年9月5日","excerpt":"","autoDesc":true}');export{l as comp,m as data};
