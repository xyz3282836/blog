Originally priced at 35 yuan ($4.80), a box of two chocolates, sold under the name Maoxiaoling, can now fetch up to 99.99 yuan. Responding to the <code>overwhelming</code> demand, Kweichow Moutai — China’s leading liquor brand — announced that it is boosting production and strongly advised consumers to only buy the chocolates from official stores. Kweichow Moutai unveiled the liquor-filled chocolates on Sept. 16, shortly after launching an <code>alcoholic</code> coffee drink in partnership with Luckin Coffee earlier this month.</p><div class="hint-container tip"><p class="hint-container-title">tips</p><p>frenzy 疯狂</p><p>surge 汹涌</p><p>surgeon 外科医生</p><p>surgery 外科</p><p>liquor 白酒；液体（和酒相关的液体）</p><p>liquid 液体（液体）；透明的</p><p>overwhelm 淹没；打击；压倒；制服</p><p>alcoholic 酒精的</p><p>alcohol 酒；酒精</p></div>',2)]))}const d=o(n,[["render",r],["__file","2309221901.html.vue"]]),h=JSON.parse('{"path":"/english/everyday/2023/2309221901.html","title":"Moutai’s Liquor-Filled Chocolates Spark Buying Frenzy in China","lang":"zh-CN","frontmatter":{"title":"Moutai’s Liquor-Filled Chocolates Spark Buying Frenzy in China","date":"2023-09-22T11:01:00.000Z","category":"英文","tag":["everyday"],"description":"A surge in demand for liquor-filled chocolates launched by Kweichow Moutai in collaboration with Mars Inc.-owned Dove has driven prices up by as much as 180% on the second-hand ...","head":[["meta",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://blog.ruizhou.cf/english/everyday/2023/2309221901.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"rz blog"}],["meta",{"property":"og:title","content":"Moutai’s Liquor-Filled Chocolates Spark Buying Frenzy in China"}],["meta",{"property":"og:description","content":"A surge in demand for liquor-filled chocolates launched by Kweichow Moutai in collaboration with Mars Inc.-owned Dove has driven prices up by as much as 180% on the second-hand ..."}],["meta",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["meta",{"property":"og:locale","content":"zh-CN"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"everyday"}],["meta",{"property":"article:published_time","content":"2023-09-22T11:01:00.000Z"}],["script",{"type":"application/ld+json"},"{\\"@context\\":\\"https://schema.org\\",\\"@type\\":\\"Article\\",\\"headline\\":\\"Moutai’s Liquor-Filled Chocolates Spark Buying Frenzy in China\\",\\"image\\":[\\"\\"],\\"datePublished\\":\\"2023-09-22T11:01:00.000Z\\",\\"dateModified\\":null,\\"author\\":[{\\"@type\\":\\"Person\\",\\"name\\":\\"ruizhou\\",\\"url\\":\\"https://blog.ruizhou.cf\\"}]}"]]},"headers":[],"readingTime":{"minutes":0.63,"words":190},"filePathRelative":"english/everyday/2023/2309221901.md","localizedDate":"2023年9月22日","excerpt":"","autoDesc":true}');export{d as comp,h as data};
