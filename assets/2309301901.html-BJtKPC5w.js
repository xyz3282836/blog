Silvia Macías of Mexico City had travelled to the Chipinque Park on the <code>outskirts</code> of the northern city of Monterrey to celebrate the 15th birthday of her son, Santiago, who has Down’s <code>syndrome</code>. Soon after they sat down to eat, the bear showed up and <code>gulped</code> down <code>french</code> <code>fries</code>, <code>enchiladas</code>, tacos and <code>salsa</code>. A video shot by her friend Angela Chapa shows Macías sitting <code>stoically</code>, inches from the bear’s mouth, holding Santiago and shielding his eyes with her hand. Macías kept her eyes <code>downcast</code> to avoid anything the bear might consider a challenge.</p><div class="hint-container tip"><p class="hint-container-title">tips</p><p>shield 保护；遮挡</p><p>leap 跳跃；剧变</p><p>picnic 野餐</p><p>devour 吞食</p><p>tacos 墨西哥卷饼</p><p>outskirt 边缘；郊外（skirt 裙子）</p><p>syndrome 并发症（drome- = run）</p><p>gulp 吞咽</p><p>french fries 最初起源于比利时，但在美国被称为 &quot;French fries&quot; 可能是因为在英语中 &quot;French&quot; 一词常用于指代与法国相关的事物</p><p>fry 油炸的</p><p>enchilada 玉米饼</p><p>salsa 洋葱做的辣调味酱</p><p>stoic 人名；斯多葛派的，禁欲主义；坚忍的</p><p>stoically 坚忍地</p><p>downcast 沮丧的（垂头丧气的，低头）</p></div>',2),r=[n];function c(d,s){return t(),o("div",null,r)}const l=e(i,[["render",c],["__file","2309301901.html.vue"]]),m=JSON.parse('{"path":"/english/everyday/2023/2309301901.html","title":"Woman shields son from black bear eating birthday picnic in Mexico","lang":"zh-CN","frontmatter":{"title":"Woman shields son from black bear eating birthday picnic in Mexico","date":"2023-09-30T11:01:00.000Z","category":"英文","tag":["everyday"],"description":"A woman in Mexico shielded her son after a bear leaped on to a picnic table, inches from his face, and devoured the tacos and enchiladas meant for his birthday dinner.
