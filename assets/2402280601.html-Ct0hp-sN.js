Set to take effect from July, the <code>toughest</code> anti-tobacco rules in the world would have banned sales to those born after Jan. 1, 2009, cut <code>nicotine</code> content in smoked tobacco products and reduced the number of tobacco retailers by more than 90%. The new <code>coalition</code> government <code>elected</code> in October confirmed the repeal will happen on Tuesday as a matter of urgency, enabling it to <code>scrap</code> the law without seeking public comment.</p><div class="hint-container tip"><p class="hint-container-title">tips</p><p>campaign 战役；运动；竞选活动（本意是在旷野中进行军事活动）</p><p>campainer 参加相关运动的人</p><p>nocotine 尼古丁</p><p>tobacco 烟草</p><p>repeal 废除；撤销</p><p>elect 选举</p><p>coalition 联合（联合政府）</p><p>scrap 放弃；拆毁；敲碎</p></div>',2),c=[n];function i(l,s){return t(),o("div",null,c)}const h=e(r,[["render",i],["__file","2402280601.html.vue"]]),m=JSON.parse('{"path":"/english/everyday/2024/02/2402280601.html","title":"New Zealand set to scrap world-first tobacco ban","lang":"zh-CN","frontmatter":{"title":"New Zealand set to scrap world-first tobacco ban","date":"2024-02-27T22:01:00.000Z","category":"英文","tag":["everyday"],"description":"New Zealand will repeal on Tuesday a world-first law banning tobacco sales for future generations, the government said, even while researchers and campaigners warned of the risk...","head":[["meta",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://blog.ruizhou.cf/english/everyday/2024/02/2402280601.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"rz blog"}],["meta",{"property":"og:title","content":"New Zealand set to scrap world-first tobacco ban"}],["meta",{"property":"og:description","content":"New Zealand will repeal on Tuesday a world-first law banning tobacco sales for future generations, the government said, even while researchers and campaigners warned of the risk..."}],["meta",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["meta",{"property":"og:locale","content":"zh-CN"}],["meta",{"property":"og:updated_time","content":"2024-02-28T11:01:59.000Z"}],["meta",{"property":"article:author","content":"ruizhou"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"everyday"}],["meta",{"property":"article:published_time","content":"2024-02-27T22:01:00.000Z"}],["meta",{"property":"article:modified_time","content":"2024-02-28T11:01:59.000Z"}],["script",{"type":"application/ld+json"},"{\\"@context\\":\\"https://schema.org\\",\\"@type\\":\\"Article\\",\\"headline\\":\\"New Zealand set to scrap world-first tobacco ban\\",\\"image\\":[\\"\\"],\\"datePublished\\":\\"2024-02-27T22:01:00.000Z\\",\\"dateModified\\":\\"2024-02-28T11:01:59.000Z\\",\\"author\\":[{\\"@type\\":\\"Person\\",\\"name\\":\\"ruizhou\\",\\"url\\":\\"https://blog.ruizhou.cf\\"}]}"]]},"headers":[],"git":{"createdTime":1709118119000,"updatedTime":1709118119000,"contributors":[{"name":"liuruizhou","email":"liuruizhou@bilibili.com","commits":1}]},"readingTime":{"minutes":0.64,"words":193},"filePathRelative":"english/everyday/2024/02/2402280601.md","localizedDate":"2024年2月28日","excerpt":"","autoDesc":true}');export{h as comp,m as data};
